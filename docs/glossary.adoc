== Glossary

Common PostScript terminology and concepts.

=== A

**Array**:: An ordered collection of PostScript objects. Arrays can contain any type of object and are created using `[` and `]` brackets or the link:/commands/references/array/[`array`] operator.

**ASCII**:: American Standard Code for Information Interchange. PostScript files are typically encoded in ASCII for portability.

=== B

**BÃ©zier Curve**:: A smooth curve defined by control points, created with the link:/commands/references/curveto/[`curveto`] operator.

**BoundingBox**:: The rectangular area that encloses all marks on a page, specified in the document's header comments.

=== C

**Clipping Path**:: A path that restricts where subsequent painting operations can mark the page. Set with link:/commands/references/clip/[`clip`] or link:/commands/references/eoclip/[`eoclip`].

**Current Point**:: The position in user space where the next path construction operator will begin. Set by link:/commands/references/moveto/[`moveto`] and updated by path construction operators.

**CTM (Current Transformation Matrix)**:: The matrix that transforms from user space to device space. Modified by link:/commands/references/translate/[`translate`], link:/commands/references/rotate/[`rotate`], and link:/commands/references/scale/[`scale`].

=== D

**Device Space**:: The coordinate system of the output device, measured in device pixels.

**Dictionary**:: A PostScript data structure that associates keys with values. Created with link:/commands/references/dict/[`dict`].

**DSC (Document Structuring Conventions)**:: Comments in PostScript files that provide document structure information, starting with `%%`.

=== E

**Executable**:: An attribute of PostScript objects indicating they should be executed when encountered. Procedures are executable arrays.

**Execution Stack**:: The stack that controls the flow of program execution.

=== F

**Fill**:: The operation of painting the interior of a path with the current color, using link:/commands/references/fill/[`fill`] or link:/commands/references/eofill/[`eofill`].

**Font**:: A collection of character shapes (glyphs) with associated metrics. Accessed with link:/commands/references/findfont/[`findfont`] and activated with link:/commands/references/setfont/[`setfont`].

=== G

**Graphics State**:: The collection of parameters that control how graphics operations affect the page, including current path, color, line width, transformation matrix, etc.

**Glyph**:: A visual representation of a character in a font.

=== I

**Imaging Model**:: PostScript's page description model, consisting of paths, painting, and text operations.

=== L

**Literal**:: An attribute of PostScript objects indicating they represent themselves rather than being executed.

=== M

**Mark**:: A special object used to delimit arrays and mark positions on the operand stack. Created with link:/commands/references/mark/[`mark`] or `[`.

=== N

**Name**:: A PostScript object that serves as an identifier. Names begin with `/` when used literally.

=== O

**Operand Stack**:: The stack where data values are stored and manipulated during PostScript execution.

**Operator**:: A built-in PostScript command that performs an operation.

=== P

**Packed Array**:: A more memory-efficient, read-only form of array introduced in PostScript Level 2. Created with link:/commands/references/packedarray/[`packedarray`].

**Path**:: A sequence of connected and disconnected subpaths that describe shapes. Constructed with operators like link:/commands/references/moveto/[`moveto`] and link:/commands/references/lineto/[`lineto`].

**Point**:: A unit of measurement equal to 1/72 of an inch.

**Procedure**:: An executable array, typically delimited by `{` and `}`.

=== R

**Raster**:: The rectangular array of pixels that forms an image.

**Resource**:: A named PostScript object such as a font, form, or pattern.

=== S

**Stack**:: A last-in, first-out (LIFO) data structure. PostScript uses multiple stacks including the operand stack, dictionary stack, and execution stack.

**Stroke**:: The operation of painting along a path with the current line width and color, using link:/commands/references/stroke/[`stroke`].

**String**:: A sequence of bytes, typically representing text. Created with parentheses `()` or the link:/commands/references/string/[`string`] operator.

=== T

**Token**:: The basic lexical element of PostScript syntax - a name, number, string, or special character sequence.

**Type**:: The classification of a PostScript object (integer, real, boolean, string, name, array, etc.).

=== U

**User Space**:: The coordinate system in which PostScript programs operate, independent of the output device. The default has origin at bottom-left with units in points.

=== V

**VM (Virtual Memory)**:: PostScript's memory management system, supporting both local and global allocation.
