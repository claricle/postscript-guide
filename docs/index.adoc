[.lead]
A comprehensive, searchable reference guide for the PostScript programming language, covering operators, syntax, language levels, and practical usage patterns.

== Welcome

PostScript is a page description language developed by Adobe Systems. It is a dynamically typed, concatenative programming language and was the first device-independent page description language. This reference guide provides detailed documentation for PostScript operators, syntax rules, and practical programming techniques.

== What is PostScript?

PostScript is a stack-based, interpreted programming language created by Adobe Systems in 1984. It was designed to describe the layout and graphics of a page in a device-independent way, making it the foundation for desktop publishing and electronic document distribution.

=== Key Features

* **Device Independence**: PostScript programs produce the same output on any PostScript-compatible device
* **Stack-Based Architecture**: Operations work with a last-in-first-out stack model
* **Turing Complete**: Full programming language with control structures, procedures, and data types
* **Vector Graphics**: Native support for scalable vector graphics and typography
* **Imaging Model**: Sophisticated graphics model supporting paths, fills, strokes, and clipping

== Quick Start

=== Hello World

Here's a simple PostScript program that displays "Hello, World!":

[source,postscript]
----
%!PS-Adobe-3.0
%%Title: Hello World
%%Creator: PostScript Language Reference Guide
%%Pages: 1
%%EndComments

/Helvetica findfont    % Find the Helvetica font
12 scalefont           % Scale to 12 points
setfont                % Set as current font

72 720 moveto          % Position at 1 inch from left, 10 inches from bottom
(Hello, World!) show   % Display the text

showpage               % Output the page
%%EOF
----

=== Basic Drawing Example

Creating a simple rectangle:

[source,postscript]
----
%!PS-Adobe-3.0

newpath                % Start a new path
100 100 moveto        % Move to starting point
200 0 rlineto         % Draw line 200 points right
0 150 rlineto         % Draw line 150 points up
-200 0 rlineto        % Draw line 200 points left
closepath             % Close the path

0.5 setgray           % Set gray level to 50%
fill                  % Fill the rectangle

showpage              % Output the page
%%EOF
