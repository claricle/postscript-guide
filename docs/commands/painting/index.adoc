== Painting

Commands for rendering paths and graphics to the page. Painting operations take paths and graphics state parameters to produce visible output.

== Overview

PostScript provides three primary painting operations:

* **Fill** - Paint inside of path
* **Stroke** - Paint along path
* **Clip** - Restrict subsequent painting to path interior
