= rrand

Returns the current state of the random number generator.

== Description

The `rrand` operator returns an integer representing the current state of the random number generator used by xref:rand.adoc[`rand`]. This state value can later be passed to xref:srand.adoc[`srand`] to restore the generator to this exact position in its sequence, allowing you to reproduce or continue a specific random sequence.

This is a Level 1 operator, available in all PostScript implementations.

== Syntax

[source,postscript]
----
- rrand int
----

|`int` (integer) - Current random generator state

== Parameters

None. The `rrand` operator takes no operands.

== Return Values

`int`:: An integer representing the current random number generator state

== Examples

=== Save and Restore State

[source,postscript]
----
% Save current state
rrand          % â†’ 1234567 (example state)
/savedState exch def

% Generate some random numbers
rand rand rand

% Restore to saved state
savedState srand

% Continue from saved point
rand           % Same sequence as after saved state
----

=== Checkpoint Random Sequence

[source,postscript]
----
% Generate random with ability to replay
/generateWithCheckpoint {
    % Save initial state
    rrand /checkpoint exch def

    % Generate and use random values
    rand 100 mod  % Use random value

    % Can restore to checkpoint later
    checkpoint srand
    rand 100 mod  % Same random value again
} def

* xref:srand.adoc[`srand`] - Seed random generator

== PostScript Level

*Available in*: PostScript Level 1 and higher

== Error Conditions

`stackoverflow`::
The operand stack is full (cannot push result).

== Best Practices

1. **Use to save/restore random state** for debugging or replay
2. **Store state before critical operations** that you may need to repeat
3. **Combine with `srand`** to implement checkpoints
