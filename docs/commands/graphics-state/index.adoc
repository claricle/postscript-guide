== Graphics State

Graphics state operations control the rendering parameters that affect how graphics are drawn on the page. The graphics state includes color, line characteristics, transformations, clipping paths, and many other attributes.

== Overview

The graphics state is a collection of parameters that control:

* **Color**: Current color (gray, RGB, CMYK, HSB)
* **Line attributes**: Width, cap style, join style, miter limit, dash pattern
* **Transformations**: Current transformation matrix (CTM)
* **Clipping**: Current clipping path
* **Font**: Current font and text parameters
* **Device**: Current output device

Each parameter has a current value that affects subsequent graphics operations.

== Graphics State Stack

PostScript provides a stack for saving and restoring graphics state:

* link:/commands/references/gsave/[`gsave`] saves current state
* link:/commands/references/grestore/[`grestore`] restores saved state
* State changes are isolated between save/restore pairs
* Enables temporary modifications without losing previous state

== Command Categories

=== State Save and Restore

| link:/commands/references/grestore/[`grestore`]
| Restore graphics state from top of stack

| link:/commands/references/grestoreall/[`grestoreall`]
| Restore to bottommost save level

| link:/commands/references/gstate/[`gstate`]

| Get current CMYK color (Level 2)

| link:/commands/references/currenthsbcolor/[`currenthsbcolor`]
| Get current HSB color
|===

== Common Patterns

=== Temporary State Changes

[source,postscript]
----
gsave
  1 setlinewidth
  0 setgray
  % Draw with these settings
  stroke
grestore
% Original settings restored
----

=== Setting Line Appearance

[source,postscript]
----
2 setlinewidth      % 2-unit wide lines
1 setlinecap        % Round caps
1 setlinejoin       % Round joins
[3 5] 0 setdash     % Dashed: 3 on, 5 off
----

=== Color Selection

[source,postscript]
----
% Grayscale
0.5 setgray         % 50% gray

% RGB
1 0 0 setrgbcolor   % Red

% CMYK (Level 2)
0 1 1 0 setcmykcolor  % Red in CMYK
----

== Important Considerations

=== State Hierarchy

Graphics state changes affect all subsequent operations until:

* Another state change occurs
* link:/commands/references/grestore/[`grestore`] restores previous state
* link:/commands/initgraphics/[`initgraphics`] resets to defaults
* Page is complete (showpage)

=== save vs. gsave

[cols="2,3,3"]
|===
| Operator | Saves | Restores

| link:/commands/references/begin/[`save`]
| VM + graphics state
| [`restore`]

| link:/commands/references/gsave/[`gsave`]
| Graphics state only
| link:/commands/references/grestore/[`grestore`]
|===

=== Device Dependence

Some parameters are device-dependent:

* Transfer functions
* Halftone screens
* Flatness
* Should not be used in device-independent documents

== Common Pitfalls

WARNING: *Unbalanced gsave/grestore* - Every link:/commands/references/gsave/[`gsave`] must have matching link:/commands/references/grestore/[`grestore`].

WARNING: *Color Space* - Color operators may switch color space (e.g., link:/commands/references/setgray/[`setgray`]) â†’ DeviceGray.

WARNING: *Dash Pattern Reset* - Empty dash array `[]` resets to solid lines.

TIP: *Bracket Graphics with gsave/grestore* - Always wrap state changes:

[source,postscript]
----
gsave
  % Temporary changes
grestore
