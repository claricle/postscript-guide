== Path Construction

Commands for building vector paths in PostScript. Paths are the fundamental building blocks for all graphics operations - they define shapes that can then be filled, stroked, or used for clipping.

== Overview

Path construction in PostScript follows a three-step process:

1. **Construct** - Build the path using moveto, lineto, curveto, arc, etc.
2. **Paint** - Apply fill, stroke, or clip operations
3. **Reset** - Use newpath to start fresh

== Command Categories

=== Basic Path Operations

|===
| Command | Description

| link:/commands/references/newpath/[`newpath`]
| Initialize path to empty

| link:/commands/references/moveto/[`moveto`]
| Set current point (start new subpath)

| link:/commands/references/lineto/[`lineto`]
| Add straight line to current point

| link:/commands/references/curveto/[`curveto`]
| Add BÃ©zier curve to path

| link:/commands/references/closepath/[`closepath`]
| Close current subpath

| link:/commands/references/currentpoint/[`currentpoint`]
| Get coordinates of current point
|===

=== Relative Path Operations

[cols="1,3"]
|===
| Command | Description

| link:/commands/references/rmoveto/[`rmoveto`]
| Relative moveto

| link:/commands/references/rlineto/[`rlineto`]
| Relative lineto

| link:/commands/references/rcurveto/[`rcurveto`]
| Relative curveto
|===

=== Arc Operations

[cols="1,3"]
|===
| Command | Description

| link:/commands/references/arc/[`arc`]
| Add counterclockwise circular arc

| link:/commands/references/arcn/[`arcn`]
| Add clockwise circular arc

| link:/commands/references/arct/[`arct`]
| Add arc defined by tangent lines

| link:/commands/references/arcto/[`arcto`]
| Like arct but returns tangent points
|===
