== cvx

Converts an object to have the executable attribute.

=== Syntax

----
any cvx â†’ any
----

=== Stack Effects

.Before
[cols="1,3"]
|===
| Level | Object

| 0
| `any` (any object)
|===

.After
[cols="1,3"]
|===
| Level | Object

| 0
| `any` (same object with executable attribute)
|===

=== Description

[`cvx`](cvx.adoc) (convert to executable) changes the attribute of the object on top of the operand stack from literal to executable.

The object itself is unchanged - only its executable/literal attribute is modified. This affects how the PostScript interpreter treats the object when it is encountered during execution.

=== PostScript Level

*Level 1* and later

=== Examples

.Converting name to executable
[source,postscript]
----
/add cvx         % Result: add (executable)
----

.Converting procedure
[source,postscript]
----
{ 1 2 add } cvx  % Result: { 1 2 add } (executable)
----

.String to executable
[source,postscript]
----
(1 2 add) cvx exec  % Executes string contents
% Result: 3
----

=== Common Use Cases

==== Dynamic Code Execution

[source,postscript]
----
(add mul sub) cvx exec  % Execute string as code
----

==== Creating Executable Arrays

[source,postscript]
----
[ /moveto /lineto /stroke ] cvx
% Creates executable procedure
----

==== File Execution

[source,postscript]
----
(filename.ps) (r) file cvx exec
% Read and execute file
----

=== Common Pitfalls

WARNING: *Execution Context* - Executable objects are executed when encountered by the interpreter.

[source,postscript]
----
/proc { 1 2 add } def
proc              % Executes (pushes 3)
/proc cvlit       % Literal (pushes procedure)
----

WARNING: *String Security* - Converting arbitrary strings to executable and executing them can be dangerous.

TIP: *Most Procedures Already Executable* - Procedures created with `{ }` are already executable.

=== Implementation Notes

* Only changes the executable/literal attribute bit
* Does not create a new object
* Works on any object type
* Complementary to xref:cvlit.adoc[`cvlit`]
