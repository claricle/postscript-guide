== cvlit

Converts an object to have the literal attribute.

=== Syntax

----
any cvlit â†’ any
----

=== Stack Effects

.Before
[cols="1,3"]
|===
| Level | Object

| 0
| `any` (any object)
|===

.After
[cols="1,3"]
|===
| Level | Object

| 0
| `any` (same object with literal attribute)
|===

=== Description

[`cvlit`](cvlit.adoc) (convert to literal) changes the attribute of the object on top of the operand stack from executable to literal.

The object itself is unchanged - only its executable/literal attribute is modified. This affects how the PostScript interpreter treats the object when it is encountered during execution.

=== PostScript Level

*Level 1* and later

=== Examples

.Converting name to literal
[source,postscript]
----
/abc cvlit       % Result: /abc (literal name)
abc cvlit        % Result: /abc (was executable, now literal)
----

.Converting procedure
[source,postscript]
----
{ 1 2 add } cvlit  % Result: { 1 2 add } (won't execute)
----

.Already literal
[source,postscript]
----
/name cvlit      % Result: /name (no change)
123 cvlit        % Result: 123 (no change)
----

=== Common Use Cases

==== Preventing Execution

[source,postscript]
----
/proc { complicated code } def
proc cvlit       % Get procedure without executing
% ... later ...
cvx exec         % Execute when ready
----

==== Building Literal Arrays

[source,postscript]
----
[ /add /mul /sub ] {
  cvlit          % Make each operator literal
} forall
3 array astore
% Literal array of operator names
----

==== Name Table Inspection

[source,postscript]
----
currentdict {
  exch cvlit exch  % Convert key to literal
  % Process key-value pair
} forall
----

=== Common Pitfalls

WARNING: *Effect on Interpretation* - Literal objects are not executed when encountered by the interpreter.

[source,postscript]
----
{ 1 2 add } cvlit exec  % Executes (push entire proc)
{ 1 2 add } exec        % Executes (pushes 3)
----

TIP: *Most Objects Are Literal* - Numbers, strings, arrays created with `[ ]`, etc. are already literal.

=== Error Conditions

[cols="1,3"]
|===
| Error | Condition

| [`stackunderflow`]
| No operand on stack

=== Implementation Notes

* Only changes the executable/literal attribute bit
* Does not create a new object (modifies in place)
* Works on any object type
* Complementary to xref:cvx.adoc[`cvx`]

=== Executable vs. Literal Comparison

[cols="2,3,3"]
|===
| Object | Literal Behavior | Executable Behavior

| Name
| Pushed on stack
| Looked up and executed

| Array/Procedure
| Pushed on stack
| Elements executed sequentially

| Number/String
| Pushed on stack
| Pushed on stack (same)

| Operator
| Pushed on stack
| Executed
