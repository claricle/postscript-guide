== array

Creates a new array of specified length with elements initialized to null.

=== Syntax

----
int array → array
----

=== Stack Effects

.Before
[cols="1,3"]
|===
| Level | Object

| 0
| `int` (non-negative integer)
|===

.After
[cols="1,3"]
|===
| Level | Object

| 0
| `array` (new array of length int)
|===

=== Description

link:/commands/references/array/[`array`] creates a new array object of length _int_, with each element initialized to null. The array is allocated in local or global VM according to the current VM allocation mode.

The _int_ operand must be:

* A non-negative integer
* Not greater than the maximum allowable array length (implementation-dependent)

=== PostScript Level

*Level 1* and later

=== Examples

.Creating a simple array
[source,postscript]
----
3 array  % Creates [null null null]
----

.Creating and populating an array
[source,postscript]
----
3 array          % [null null null]
dup 0 42 put     % [42 null null]
dup 1 (hello) put  % [42 (hello) null]
dup 2 /name put  % [42 (hello) /name]
----

.Dynamic array with loop
[source,postscript]
----
5 array          % Create 5-element array
0 1 4 {          % Loop from 0 to 4
  2 copy         % Duplicate index and array
  exch           % index array → array index
  dup 10 mul     % Multiply index by 10
  put            % Store in array
} for
% Result: [0 10 20 30 40]
----

=== Common Use Cases

==== Building Data Structures

[source,postscript]
----
% Create a point structure
2 array
dup 0 100 put  % x coordinate
dup 1 200 put  % y coordinate
----

==== Temporary Storage

[source,postscript]
----
% Store interim calculation results
10 array
% ... fill with computed values ...
----

=== Common Pitfalls

WARNING: *Uninitialized Elements* - Remember that link:/commands/references/array/[`array`] initializes all elements to null. You must explicitly populate the array before using its elements.

[source,postscript]
----
3 array
0 get   % Returns null, not an error
----

WARNING: *VM Allocation* - Arrays are allocated in VM. Creating many large arrays can exhaust available memory.

TIP: *Array Literals vs. array Operator* - For known, fixed-size arrays, use the literal syntax `[ ... ]` instead. Use link:/commands/references/array/[`array`] when the size is computed dynamically.

=== Error Conditions

[cols="1,3"]
|===
| Error | Condition

| [`limitcheck`]
| _int_ exceeds implementation's maximum array length

| [`rangecheck`]
| _int_ is negative

| [`stackunderflow`]
| Fewer than 1 operand on stack

| [`typecheck`]
| Operand is not an integer

| [`VMerror`]
| Insufficient VM to allocate array
|===

=== Implementation Notes

* Most PostScript implementations support arrays up to at least 65,535 elements
* Array allocation is typically faster for small arrays
* Consider using link:/commands/references/packedarray/[`packedarray`] for read-only data (Level 2)

=== Performance Considerations

* Creating many small arrays is more efficient than a few large ones
* Pre-allocating arrays of known size is more efficient than growing them dynamically
* For large datasets, consider using dictionaries as an alternative
