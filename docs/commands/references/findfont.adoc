== findfont

Obtain font dictionary by name.

=== Syntax

```
key findfont font
```

=== Stack Effects

**Before:**
```
key
```

**After:**
```
font
```

=== Description

link:/docs/commands/references/findfont/[`findfont`] obtains a font dictionary identified by the specified `key` and pushes it on the operand stack. The `key` may be a key previously passed to link:/docs/commands/references/definefont/[`definefont`], in which case the font dictionary associated with `key` (in the font directory) is returned.

If `key` is not registered as a font in VM, link:/docs/commands/references/findfont/[`findfont`] takes an action that varies according to the environment in which the PostScript interpreter is operating. In some environments, link:/docs/commands/references/findfont/[`findfont`] may attempt to read a font definition from an external source, such as a file. In other environments, link:/docs/commands/references/findfont/[`findfont`] substitutes a default font or executes the error `invalidfont`.

link:/docs/commands/references/findfont/[`findfont`] is a special case of `findresource` applied to the Font category.

link:/docs/commands/references/findfont/[`findfont`], like `findresource`, normally looks first for fonts defined in local VM, then for fonts defined in global VM. However, if the current VM allocation mode is global, link:/docs/commands/references/findfont/[`findfont`] considers only fonts defined in global VM. If link:/docs/commands/references/findfont/[`findfont`] needs to load a font into VM, it may use either local or global VM, depending on the font. Generally, Type 1 fonts are loaded into global VM; fonts of other types are loaded into local VM.

link:/docs/commands/references/findfont/[`findfont`] is not an operator, but rather a built-in procedure. It may be redefined by a PostScript language program that requires different strategies for finding fonts.

=== Parameters

**key** (`name` or `string`)
: The name of the font to find (e.g., `/Helvetica`, `/Times-Roman`)

=== Returns

**font** (`dictionary`)
: The font dictionary associated with the specified key

=== Examples

==== Basic Font Loading

```postscript
/Helvetica findfont
% Returns the Helvetica font dictionary
```

==== Loading and Using a Font

```postscript
/Times-Roman findfont    % Get Times-Roman font
12 scalefont             % Scale to 12 points
setfont                  % Set as current font
```

==== Font with Fallback

```postscript
{
  /MyCustomFont findfont
} stopped {
  pop  % Remove error
  /Helvetica findfont  % Use fallback font
} if
```

=== Errors

**invalidfont**
: If the font name is not valid or the font dictionary is malformed

**stackunderflow**
: If the operand stack is empty

**typecheck**
: If `key` is not a name or string

=== Font Discovery

The font discovery mechanism varies by implementation:

1. **Local VM fonts** - Defined by link:/docs/commands/references/definefont/[`definefont`] in local VM
2. **Global VM fonts** - Defined by link:/docs/commands/references/definefont/[`definefont`] in global VM
3. **External fonts** - Loaded from font files or other external sources
4. **Substitution fonts** - Default fonts substituted when requested font not found

=== VM Allocation

When loading fonts from external sources:

- **Type 1 fonts** are typically loaded into global VM
- **Other font types** are typically loaded into local VM
- The current VM allocation mode affects which fonts are visible
