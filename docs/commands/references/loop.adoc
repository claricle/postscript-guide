== loop

Repeatedly executes a procedure indefinitely until exit is called.

=== Syntax

----
proc loop → –
----

=== Stack Effects

.Before
[cols="1,3"]
|===
| Level | Object

| 0
| `proc` (procedure to execute)
|===

.After
[cols="1,3"]
|===
| Level | Object

| (varies)
| Results from procedure executions
|===

=== Description

link:/docs/commands/references/loop/[`loop`] repeatedly executes _proc_ until _proc_ executes link:/docs/commands/references/exit/[`exit`], at which point interpretation resumes after the loop.

Control also leaves _proc_ if link:/docs/commands/references/stop/[`stop`] is executed. If _proc_ never executes link:/docs/commands/references/exit/[`exit`] or link:/docs/commands/references/stop/[`stop`], an infinite loop results.

=== PostScript Level

*Level 1* and later

=== Examples

.Loop with exit condition
[source,postscript]
----
0 {
  dup 10 ge { exit } if
  dup =
  1 add
} loop
pop
% Prints: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
----

.Reading until condition
[source,postscript]
----
file {
  read not { exit } if
  % Process character
} loop
----

.Infinite server loop
[source,postscript]
----
{
  % Wait for request
  % Process request
  % Send response
} loop
----

=== Common Use Cases

==== Event Loop

[source,postscript]
----
{
  waitForEvent
  dup /quit eq { exit } if
  processEvent
} loop
----

==== File Processing

[source,postscript]
----
{
  file readline not { exit } if
  processLine
} loop
----

==== Search with Early Exit

[source,postscript]
----
/found false def
0 {
  array exch get
  dup target eq {
    /found true def
    exit
  } if
  pop
} loop
----

=== Common Pitfalls

WARNING: *Infinite Loops* - Without link:/docs/commands/references/exit/[`exit`] or link:/docs/commands/references/stop/[`stop`], loop runs forever.

[source,postscript]
----
{ (infinite) print } loop  % Never stops!
----

WARNING: *Stack Growth* - Ensure loop body balances stack or it will overflow.

[source,postscript]
----
{ 1 } loop  % Stack overflow eventually
----

TIP: *Use External Interrupt* - Infinite loops can be broken via implementation-specific external interrupts (e.g., Ctrl-C).

=== Error Conditions

[cols="1,3"]
|===
| Error | Condition

| [`stackunderflow`]
| No operand on stack

| [`typecheck`]
| Operand is not a procedure
|===

=== Implementation Notes

* No iteration limit checked
* Very lightweight (minimal overhead per iteration)
* Procedure must contain exit logic
* Common pattern for server loops

=== Typical Pattern

[source,postscript]
----
{
  % 1. Get/wait for input
  getData

  % 2. Check termination
  dup shouldExit { pop exit } if

  % 3. Process
  process

  % 4. Loop continues
} loop
