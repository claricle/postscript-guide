== grestoreall

Restores graphics state to bottommost saved level.

=== Syntax

----
– grestoreall → –
----

=== Stack Effects

.Before
[cols="1,3"]
|===
| Level | Object

| (empty)
| –

.After
[cols="1,3"]

| Level | Object

| (empty)
| Graphics state stack cleared to bottommost level
|===

=== Description

link:/commands/references/grestoreall/[`grestoreall`] performs the equivalent of executing link:/commands/references/grestore/[`grestore`] repeatedly until there are no saved graphics states remaining on the graphics state stack. After executing link:/commands/references/grestoreall/[`grestoreall`], the current graphics state is the bottommost one that was saved by the first link:/commands/references/gsave/[`gsave`] or by link:/commands/references/save/[`save`].

This operator:

* Restores graphics state to the initial level
* Clears all intermediate saved states
* Resets the current path to empty
* Does not affect the operand or dictionary stacks

link:/commands/references/grestoreall/[`grestoreall`] is particularly useful for error recovery and cleanup, ensuring a known graphics state regardless of how many link:/commands/references/gsave/[`gsave`] operations have been performed.

=== PostScript Level

*Level 1* and later

=== Examples

.Error recovery
[source,postscript]
----
% May have unknown gsave depth
drawComplexFigure  % Unknown number of gsaves

% Ensure clean state
grestoreall
% Now at bottommost level
----

.Cleanup after nested operations
[source,postscript]
----
gsave
  gsave
    gsave
      % Deep nesting
      drawContent
    grestore
  grestore
grestore

% Simpler cleanup
gsave
gsave
gsave
drawContent
grestoreall  % All undone at once
----

.Guaranteed reset
[source,postscript]
----
/DrawSafe {
  % Save known state
  gsave

  % Call potentially unsafe code
  drawUnknownContent

  % Ensure cleanup regardless of gsave count
  grestoreall

  % Restore to known state
  grestore
} def
----

.Exception handling
[source,postscript]
----
{
  % Operation that might gsave multiple times
  complexOperation
} stopped {
  % On error, clean up graphics state
  grestoreall
  handleError
} if
----

=== Common Use Cases

==== Error Recovery

[source,postscript]
----
/SafeExecute {
  % code
  {
    gsave
    exec
    grestore
  } stopped {
    % Clean up on error
    grestoreall
    % Re-establish base state
    initializeGraphicsState
  } if
} def
----

==== Nested Drawing Cleanup

[source,postscript]
----
/DrawWithUnknownDepth {
  % Don't know how many gsaves were done
  callThirdPartyCode

  % Ensure we're back to base
  grestoreall
} def
----

==== State Reset

[source,postscript]
----
/ResetGraphicsState {
  grestoreall
  initgraphics
  initmatrix
} def
----

==== Page Boundary

[source,postscript]
----
/EndPage {
  % Restore to page start state
  grestoreall

  % Show page
  showpage
} def
----

=== Common Pitfalls

WARNING: *Clears ALL Saved States* - link:/commands/references/grestoreall/[`grestoreall`] removes all graphics states, not just one.

[source,postscript]
----
gsave  % State 1
gsave  % State 2
gsave  % State 3

grestoreall  % Back to state 0 (not state 2)
----

WARNING: *Does Not Restore Operand Stack* - Only graphics state is affected.

[source,postscript]
----
1 2 3
gsave
4 5 6
grestoreall
% Stack: 1 2 3 4 5 6 (not 1 2 3)
----

WARNING: *Current Path Reset* - Like link:/commands/references/grestore/[`grestore`], the current path becomes empty.

[source,postscript]
----
newpath 0 0 moveto 100 100 lineto
gsave
grestoreall
% Path is now empty
----

TIP: *Use for Error Handling* - Ideal for ensuring clean state after errors.

=== Error Conditions

No errors under normal operation. link:/commands/references/grestoreall/[`grestoreall`] succeeds even if no graphics states were saved.

=== Implementation Notes

* Equivalent to repeated link:/commands/references/grestore/[`grestore`] until no saved states remain
* Very fast operation
* Safe to call even if no states are saved
* Does not generate errors
* Clears current path
* Ideal for cleanup and error recovery
* Often used with [`stopped`]

=== Graphics State Stack Behavior

.Before grestoreall
[source]
----
Current State (level 3) ← current
Saved State 2
Saved State 1
Saved State 0          ← bottommost
----

.After grestoreall
[source]
----
Saved State 0          ← current (bottommost)
----

=== Interaction with save/restore

link:/commands/references/grestoreall/[`grestoreall`] restores graphics state to the bottommost level **within the current save context**. It does not cross link:/commands/references/save/[`save`] boundaries:

[source,postscript]
----
gsave              % Graphics state 1
save               % VM snapshot
gsave              % Graphics state 2
grestoreall        % Restores to state after save
% Still within save context
restore            % Returns to before save
% Now at graphics state 1
----
