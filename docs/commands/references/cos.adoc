= cos

Returns the cosine of an angle in degrees.

== Description

The `cos` operator pops an angle (in degrees) from the operand stack and pushes its cosine value. The angle is interpreted in degrees, not radians. The result is always a real number.

This is a Level 1 operator, available in all PostScript implementations.

== Syntax

[source,postscript]
----
angle cos real

|`real` (real) - Cosine of angle

== Parameters

`angle`:: An angle in degrees (integer or real)

== Return Values

`real`:: cos(angle) where angle is in degrees (always real, range -1.0 to 1.0)

== Examples

=== Basic Usage

[source,postscript]
----
% Key angles
0 cos          % → 1.0 (cos(0°))
60 cos         % → 0.5 (cos(60°))
90 cos         % → 0.0 (cos(90°))
180 cos        % → -1.0 (cos(180°))
