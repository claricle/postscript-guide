== Dictionary Operations

Dictionary operations provide PostScript's primary mechanism for associating keys with values. Dictionaries serve as namespaces, configuration stores, and the foundation for the language's scoping and name lookup mechanisms.

== Overview

Dictionaries in PostScript are:

* **Key-value stores**: Associate arbitrary keys (typically names) with values
* **Scoped namespaces**: Organized in a dictionary stack for hierarchical lookup
* **Dynamic**: Can grow beyond initial capacity (Level 2)
* **Fundamental**: Used for variable storage, procedure definitions, and system configuration

== Dictionary Stack

PostScript maintains a dictionary stack that controls name lookup:

* Top dictionary is searched first (current dictionary)
* Search proceeds down the stack until name is found
* Standard dictionaries: `systemdict`, `globaldict` (Level 2), `userdict`
* User dictionaries can be pushed/popped with link:/commands/references/begin/[`begin`] / link:/commands/references/end/[`end`]

== Common Patterns

=== Creating and Using Dictionaries

[source,postscript]
----
% Create a dictionary with initial capacity
5 dict begin
  /width 100 def
  /height 200 def
  /color /red def
end

% Use the dictionary
currentdict /width get  % Returns 100
----

=== Dictionary as Configuration

[source,postscript]
----
/config 10 dict def
config begin
  /fontSize 12 def
  /fontName /Helvetica def
  /lineHeight 14 def
end

% Access configuration
config /fontSize get
----

=== Name Lookup

[source,postscript]
----
% Define in current dictionary
/myvar 42 def

% Find which dictionary contains it
/myvar where {
  % Found - dictionary is on stack
  /myvar get  % Get the value
} {
  % Not found
  /myvar load  % Will cause undefined error
} ifelse
----

== Important Considerations

=== Dictionary Stack Hierarchy

The standard dictionary stack (bottom to top):

1. `systemdict` - Read-only system definitions
2. `globaldict` - Global definitions (Level 2)
3. `userdict` - User definitions
4. User-created dictionaries (via `begin`)

=== Level 1 vs. Level 2 Differences

**Level 1:**
* Fixed capacity - [`dictfull`] error if exceeded
* Must specify sufficient size at creation
* No global VM concept

**Level 2:**
* Auto-expanding - grows beyond initial capacity
* Initial size is optimization hint
* Global vs. local VM distinctions

=== VM Allocation

* Dictionaries allocated in local or global VM based on allocation mode
* Global VM dictionaries persist across jobs
* Cannot store local VM objects in global VM dictionaries

=== Access Control

* Dictionaries can be made readonly
* Readonly dictionaries cannot have entries added/modified
* No-access prevents reading contents

== Common Pitfalls

WARNING: *Dictionary Stack Balance* - Every link:/commands/references/begin/[`begin`] must have matching link:/commands/references/end/[`end`]. Unbalanced stacks cause [`dictstackunderflow`] or [`dictstackoverflow`].

WARNING: *Fixed Capacity (Level 1)* - In Level 1, exceeding dictionary capacity causes [`dictfull`] error. Always allocate sufficient space.

WARNING: *Global/Local VM* - Cannot store local VM objects into global VM dictionaries - causes [`invalidaccess`].

TIP: *Use begin/end Blocks* - Bracket dictionary use with `begin`/`end` for scoped access:

[source,postscript]
----
mydict begin
  % Definitions go into mydict
  /key value def
end
