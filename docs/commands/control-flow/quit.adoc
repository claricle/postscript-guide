Terminates operation of the PostScript interpreter.

=== Description

[`quit`](quit.adoc) terminates operation of the PostScript interpreter. The precise action depends on the environment:

* May return control to operating system
* May halt or restart the machine
* In multi-context systems (DPS): terminates current context only

In job server environments, [`quit`](quit.adoc) in `userdict` is usually redefined to mean xref:stop.adoc[`stop`] (terminate job, not interpreter).

=== PostScript Level

*Level 1* and later

=== Examples

.Terminating interpreter
[source,postscript]
----
% After all processing
showpage
quit
----

.In userdict (job server)
[source,postscript]
----
% userdict /quit is typically:
/quit { stop } def

quit  % Ends job, not interpreter
----

.Accessing systemdict quit
[source,postscript]
----
systemdict /quit get exec  % True interpreter termination
----

=== Common Use Cases

==== Script Termination

[source,postscript]
----
% At end of standalone script
cleanup
quit
----

==== Conditional Termination

[source,postscript]
----
fatalError {
  (Fatal error - terminating) print
  quit
} if
----

=== Common Pitfalls

WARNING: *userdict Redefinition* - In job server environments, `userdict /quit` is usually redefined.

[source,postscript]
----
quit  % Usually stops job, not interpreter
systemdict /quit get exec  % Actually quits
----

WARNING: *Immediate Termination* - [`quit`](quit.adoc) terminates immediately, no cleanup.

[source,postscript]
----
{
  openResources
  quit  % Resources not cleaned up!
} stopped {
  cleanup
} if
----

TIP: *Use stop in Jobs* - In encapsulated jobs, use xref:stop.adoc[`stop`] instead of [`quit`](quit.adoc).

=== Error Conditions

|===
| Error | Condition

| [`invalidaccess`]
| In encapsulated job, accessing systemdict quit
|===

=== Implementation Notes

* In DPS: terminates context immediately
* In job servers: userdict version usually shadows systemdict
* Standard quit in systemdict requires unencapsulated job
* Termination is immediate (no cleanup)

=== Job Server Behavior

In environments with job control:

[source,postscript]
----
% userdict typically contains:
userdict /quit { stop } put

% So:
quit              % Stops current job
systemdict begin
  quit            % Actually quits interpreter
end
