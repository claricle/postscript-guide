== kshow

Show text with kerning procedure between characters.

=== Syntax

----
proc string kshow → -
----

=== Stack Effects

**Before:**
```
proc string
```

**After:**
```
(empty)
```

=== Description

[`kshow`](kshow.adoc) paints the characters of `string` in a manner similar to [`show`](show.adoc), but allowing program intervention between characters.

If the character codes in `string` are c₀, c₁, ... cₙ, [`kshow`](kshow.adoc) proceeds as follows:

1. Shows c₀ at the current point, updating the current point by c₀'s width
2. Pushes character codes c₀ and c₁ on the operand stack (as integers)
3. Executes `proc`
4. Continues by showing c₁, pushing c₁ and c₂, executing `proc`, and so on
5. Finishes by pushing cₙ₋₁ and cₙ, executing `proc`, and showing cₙ

When `proc` is called for the first time, the graphics state (in particular, the CTM) is the same as it was at the time [`kshow`](kshow.adoc) was invoked, except that the current point has been updated by the width of c₀. Execution of `proc` is permitted to have any side effects, including changes to the graphics state. Such changes persist from one call of `proc` to the next and may affect graphical output for the remainder of [`kshow`](kshow.adoc)'s execution and afterward.

The name [`kshow`](kshow.adoc) is derived from "kern-show." To kern characters is to adjust the spacing between adjacent pairs of characters in order to achieve a visually pleasing result. The [`kshow`](kshow.adoc) operator enables user-defined kerning and other manipulations, because arbitrary computations can be performed between each pair of characters.

[`kshow`](kshow.adoc) can be applied only to base fonts. If the current font is composite, [`kshow`](kshow.adoc) issues an `invalidfont` error.

=== Parameters

**proc** (`procedure`)
: Procedure to execute between each character pair; receives two character codes on stack

**string** (`string`)
: The text to display

=== Procedure Arguments

When `proc` is called, the stack contains:

```
char(n-1) char(n)
```

Where:
- `char(n-1)` is the character just shown
- `char(n)` is the next character to be shown

=== Examples

==== Simple Kerning Table

[source,postscript]
----
% Define kerning pairs
/kernPairs <<
  /AV -2    % Kern A-V pair by -2 units
  /Aw -1    % Kern A-w pair by -1 unit
  /To -1.5  % Kern T-o pair by -1.5 units
  /We -1    % Kern W-e pair by -1 unit
>> def

% Kerning procedure
/kern {  % char1 char2 kern -
  % Convert to name
  2 copy
  =string cvs exch =string cvs
  exch concatstrings cvn

  % Look up kerning
  kernPairs exch known {
    kernPairs exch get
    0 rmoveto
  } {
    pop pop
  } ifelse
} def

/Helvetica findfont 24 scalefont setfont
100 700 moveto
/kern load (WAVE) kshow
----

==== Inter-Character Effects

[source,postscript]
----
% Add dots between characters
/dotProc {  % char1 char2 dotProc -
  pop pop  % Ignore character codes
  currentpoint
  0.5 0 rmoveto
  0 0 1 0 360 arc fill
  moveto
  1 0 rmoveto  % Extra space after dot
} def

100 700 moveto
/dotProc load (SPACED) kshow
----

==== Dynamic Spacing Based on Character Pairs

[source,postscript]
----
% Tighter spacing for lowercase, wider for uppercase
/adaptiveKern {  % char1 char2 adaptiveKern -
  % Check if both are uppercase (65-90)
  dup 65 ge 1 index 90 le and
  2 index 65 ge 3 index 90 le and and {
    % Both uppercase: add space
    pop pop
    1 0 rmoveto
  } {
    % At least one lowercase: reduce space
    pop pop
    -0.3 0 rmoveto
  } ifelse
} def

100 700 moveto
/adaptiveKern load (MixedCase TEXT) kshow
----

==== Tracking Adjustment

[source,postscript]
----
% Progressively increase spacing through string
/progressiveSpacing {  % char1 char2 progressiveSpacing -
  pop pop
  currentpoint /y exch def /x exch def
  /spacing spacing 0.1 add def
  x spacing add y moveto
} def

/spacing 0 def
100 700 moveto
/progressiveSpacing load (EXPANDING) kshow
----

=== Errors

**invalidaccess**
: Font or string has restricted access

**invalidfont**
: Current font is not valid or is a composite font

**nocurrentpoint**
: Current point is not defined

**stackunderflow**
: Fewer than two operands on stack

**typecheck**
: `proc` is not a procedure or `string` is not a string

=== Procedure Execution Context

The `proc` procedure:

**Can access:**
- All graphics state parameters
- Character codes being processed
- Current point (via `currentpoint`)

**Can modify:**
- Current point (via `rmoveto`, `moveto`)
- Graphics state (colors, line width, etc.)
- Any PostScript state

**Receives:**
- Two integers on stack (previous and next character codes)

**Should return:**
- No specific return value required
- Stack should be clean (pop operands or leave results intentionally)

=== Common Kerning Patterns

==== Letter Pair Kerning

Common pairs that benefit from kerning:

[cols="1,1,2"]
|===
| Pair | Adjustment | Reason

| AV, AW, Av, Aw
| Negative
| Diagonal creates visual gap

| To, Tr, Tu
| Negative
| Overhang opportunity

| LT, LY
| Negative
| Height difference

| ff, fi, fl
| Negative
| Ligature-like pairs

| WA, Wa
| Negative
| Diagonal intersection
|===

==== Optical Kerning

[source,postscript]
----
% Kern based on character shapes, not just codes
/opticalKern {  % char1 char2 opticalKern -
  % Check for diagonal-straight combinations
  exch dup 65 eq exch 86 eq or  % A or V
  1 index dup 84 eq exch 87 eq or  % T or W
  and {
    -1.5 0 rmoveto
  } {
    pop
  } ifelse
} def

/Helvetica findfont 18 scalefont setfont
100 700 moveto
/opticalKern load (WAVES TRAVEL) kshow
----

=== Performance Considerations

- **Most expensive** text operator due to procedure calls
- Called `length(string) - 1` times
- Procedure invocation overhead per character pair
- Graphics state changes persist
- Use only when necessary for typographic quality

Performance comparison:
```
show           - Fastest
ashow          - Fast (simple arithmetic)
widthshow      - Fast (conditional check)
awidthshow     - Moderate (two conditionals)
kshow          - Slowest (procedure calls)
```

=== Kerning Best Practices

**Define kerning tables:**
- Store kerning pairs in dictionaries
- Precompute common adjustments
- Use efficient lookup structures

**Minimize procedure complexity:**
- Keep `proc` as simple as possible
- Avoid unnecessary calculations
- Cache computed values when possible

**Test with target fonts:**
- Kerning values are font-specific
- Verify with actual font metrics
- Adjust for different point sizes

=== Limitations

**Composite fonts:**
: [`kshow`](kshow.adoc) cannot be used with composite fonts; use [`cshow`](cshow.adoc) instead

**Character boundaries:**
: Procedure is called between characters, not within character rendering

**Stack management:**
: Procedure must properly manage the character code operands
