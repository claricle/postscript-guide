== scalefont

Scale font by uniform factor.

=== Syntax

```
font scale scalefont font'
```

=== Stack Effects

**Before:**
```
font scale
```

**After:**
```
font'
```

=== Description

xref:../scalefont.adoc[`scalefont`] applies the scale factor `scale` to `font`, producing a new `font'` whose characters are scaled by `scale` (in both x and y) when they are shown. xref:../scalefont.adoc[`scalefont`] first creates a copy of `font`, then replaces the new font's `FontMatrix` entry with the result of scaling the existing `FontMatrix` by `scale`.

It inserts two additional entries, `OrigFont` and `ScaleMatrix`, whose purpose is internal to the implementation. Finally, it returns the result as `font'`.

Showing characters from the transformed font produces the same results as showing from the original font after having scaled user space by the factor `scale` in both x and y by means of the link:../transformations/scale.adoc[`scale`] operator.

xref:../scalefont.adoc[`scalefont`] is essentially a convenience operator that enables the desired scale factor to be encapsulated in the font description. Another operator, xref:../makefont.adoc[`makefont`], performs more general transformations than simple scaling.

The interpreter keeps track of font dictionaries recently created by xref:../scalefont.adoc[`scalefont`]. Calling xref:../scalefont.adoc[`scalefont`] multiple times with the same font and scale will usually return the same `font'` rather than create a new one each time. However, it is usually more efficient for a PostScript language program to apply xref:../scalefont.adoc[`scalefont`] only once for each font that it needs and to keep track of the resulting font dictionaries on its own.

=== VM Allocation

The xref:../makefont.adoc[`makefont`], xref:../scalefont.adoc[`scalefont`], and link:../graphics-state/selectfont.adoc[`selectfont`] operators produce a font dictionary derived from an original font dictionary, but with the `FontMatrix` entry altered. The derived font dictionary is allocated in local or global VM according to whether the original font dictionary is in local or global VM. This is independent of the current VM allocation mode.

=== Parameters

**font** (`dictionary`)
: The original font dictionary to scale

**scale** (`number`)
: The uniform scale factor to apply in both x and y dimensions

=== Returns

**font'** (`dictionary`)
: A new font dictionary with scaled character metrics

=== Examples

==== Basic Font Scaling

```postscript
/Helvetica findfont    % Get Helvetica font
12 scalefont           % Scale to 12 points
setfont                % Set as current font
```

==== Creating Multiple Sizes

```postscript
/Helvetica findfont
dup 10 scalefont /H10 exch def   % 10-point Helvetica
dup 12 scalefont /H12 exch def   % 12-point Helvetica
    18 scalefont /H18 exch def   % 18-point Helvetica
```

==== Scaling for Different Units

```postscript
% The standard font has 1-unit line height
/Helvetica findfont
12 scalefont setfont

% Creates a 12-unit high font (12-point in default user space)
% Characters have same proportions as original font
```

=== Errors

**invalidfont**
: If `font` is not a valid font dictionary

**stackunderflow**
: If fewer than two operands are on the stack

**typecheck**
: If `font` is not a dictionary or `scale` is not a number

**undefined**
: If required font dictionary entries are missing

=== Font Scaling Behavior

The scale factor affects:

- Character widths in both x and y
- Character heights
- All font metrics proportionally

The scale transformation is applied by modifying the `FontMatrix`:

```
FontMatrix' = [scale 0 0 scale 0 0] Ã— FontMatrix
```
