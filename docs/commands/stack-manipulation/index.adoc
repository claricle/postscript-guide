Commands for manipulating the operand stack in PostScript.

== Overview

The operand stack is fundamental to PostScript execution. These operators provide essential capabilities for managing stack contents, including duplicating, exchanging, copying, and removing elements.

== Common Patterns

Stack manipulation operators are often used in combination:

[source,postscript]
----
% Duplicate and swap
5 dup exch          % Create two copies and swap positions

% Copy multiple elements
1 2 3 3 copy        % Duplicate top 3 elements

% Access deep element
a b c d 3 index     % Copy element 3 positions down
