== Introduction

Welcome to the PostScript Language Reference Guide - your comprehensive resource for mastering PostScript programming.

== What is PostScript?

PostScript is a stack-based, interpreted programming language created by Adobe Systems in 1984. It revolutionized desktop publishing by providing a device-independent way to describe pages for printing and display.

=== Key Characteristics

**Stack-Based Execution**

PostScript uses a last-in, first-out (LIFO) stack for all operations:

[source,postscript]
----
3 4 add    % Push 3, push 4, add them → 7
5 mul      % Multiply by 5 → 35
----

**Concatenative Language**

Operations are composed by concatenation - no explicit function calls or variable assignments needed:

[source,postscript]
----
/square { dup mul } def
5 square   % Result: 25
----

**Device Independent**

The same PostScript program produces identical output on any PostScript-compatible device, from laser printers to imagesetters.

=== Core Concepts

**The Operand Stack**

Central to PostScript - all data flows through the stack:

[source,postscript]
----
10 20      % Stack: 10 20
add        % Stack: 30
2 div      % Stack: 15
----

**Dictionaries**

PostScript's namespaces - mapping names to values:

[source,postscript]
----
/x 100 def      % Define x as 100
/y 200 def      % Define y as 200
x y add         % Use them: 300
----

**Procedures**

Reusable code blocks:

[source,postscript]
----
/drawBox {
  0 0 moveto
  100 0 lineto
  100 100 lineto
  0 100 lineto
  closepath
} def
----

**Graphics Model**

Powerful vector graphics based on paths:

[source,postscript]
----
newpath
100 100 moveto    % Start point
200 150 lineto    % Draw line
stroke            % Render the path
----

== Why Learn PostScript?

**Professional Publishing**

* Industry standard for prepress and printing
* Precise control over typography and layout
* Support for complex color management

**PDF Foundation**

* PDF is derived from PostScript
* Understanding PostScript helps with PDF manipulation
* Many PDF tools use PostScript internally

**Programmatic Graphics**

* Generate graphics algorithmically
* Create custom visual effects
* Automate document production

**Legacy Systems**

* Many existing systems use PostScript
* Understanding enables maintenance and updates
* Integration with modern workflows

== Getting Started

=== Your First Program

[source,postscript]
----
%!PS-Adobe-3.0
/Helvetica findfont 12 scalefont setfont
100 700 moveto
