== PostScript Level 3

Advanced features and optimizations released in 1997, adding better color management, improved imaging, and enhanced performance.

== Overview

PostScript Level 3 builds on Level 2 with enhanced color management, smoother shading, improved font handling, and better performance. It maintains full backward compatibility with Levels 1 and 2.

== Key Enhancements

=== Color Management

* **ICC-Based Color**: Industry-standard color profiles
* **Device-Independent Color**: Accurate color across devices
* **CIE-Based Color Spaces**: Lab, XYZ color specifications
* **Rendering Intents**: Perceptual, colorimetric, saturation
* **Color Conversion**: Automatic color space conversion

=== Advanced Graphics

* **Smooth Shading**: Gradient fills with smooth transitions
* **Shading Patterns**: Type 2 and Type 3 patterns
* **Improved Transparency**: Better blending modes
* **Anti-aliasing**: Smoother rendering of shapes and text
* **Clipping**: Enhanced clipping operations

=== Font Improvements

* **CID-Keyed Fonts**: Better Asian language support
* **Font Subsetting**: Embed only used characters
* **Font Downloading**: Improved incremental downloading
* **OpenType Support**: Enhanced font format compatibility

=== Performance Enhancements

* **In-RIP Separations**: Device-side color separation
* **Page Independence**: Parallel page processing
* **Improved Caching**: Better resource utilization
* **Binary Object Sequences**: Faster data transmission
* **Optimized Operators**: Performance-tuned operations

=== New Features

* **Masked Images**: Alpha channel support
* **Image Interpolation**: Smoother image scaling
* **In-line Images**: Embedded image data
* **DeviceN Color**: Multi-channel spot colors
* **Trapping**: Automatic color trapping

== New Operators

Level 3 added numerous operators, including:

* `shfill` - Smooth shading fills
* `setsmoothness` - Control rendering quality
* `setblackgeneration`, `setundercolorremoval` - Color control
* `sethalftone` improvements - Better screening
* Image masking operators
* DeviceN color operators
* Trapping operators
* And many more...

== Device Features

=== Page Device Enhancements

* **Duplex Printing**: Two-sided output control
* **Collation**: Automatic page ordering
* **Media Selection**: Paper size and type
* **Output Management**: Advanced job control
* **Device-Specific Features**: Manufacturer extensions

=== Imaging Features

* **Resolution Independence**: Scale without quality loss
* **Spot Color Support**: Multiple ink channels
* **Overprint Control**: Precise ink layering
* **Halftone Screens**: Improved screening algorithms

== Backward Compatibility

Level 3 maintains complete compatibility:

* All Level 1 and 2 operators work unchanged
* Existing programs run without modification
* New features gracefully degrade on older interpreters
* Optional feature detection available

== Common Use Cases

=== High-Quality Color Printing

[source,postscript]
----
% ICC-based color workflow
[/ICCBased currentdict /IccProfile get] setcolorspace
0.5 0.3 0.8 setcolor
----

=== Smooth Gradients

[source,postscript]
----
% Smooth shading from blue to red
<< /ShadingType 2
   /ColorSpace /DeviceRGB
   /Coords [0 0 100 0]
   /Function << /FunctionType 2
                /Domain [0 1]
                /C0 [0 0 1]  % Blue
                /C1 [1 0 0]  % Red
                /N 1 >>
>> shfill
----

=== Image Masking

[source,postscript]
----
% Use one image to mask another
/MaskedImage <<
  /ImageType 3
  /InterLeave 1
  /DataSource imagedata
  /MaskDict maskdict
>> def
----

== Performance Tips

TIP: *Use Smooth Shading* - Replace gradient fills with `shfill` for better performance and quality.

TIP: *Enable In-RIP Separations* - Let the RIP handle color separation for faster processing.

TIP: *Use Binary Encoding* - Binary object sequences are faster than ASCII.

== Best Practices

* Use ICC color profiles for consistent color output
* Leverage smooth shading for gradients
* Take advantage of font subsetting for smaller files
* Use image interpolation for better scaling quality
* Enable anti-aliasing for professional output
