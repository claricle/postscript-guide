== PostScript Level 1

The original PostScript specification, released in 1984 by Adobe Systems.

== Overview

PostScript Level 1 established the foundation of the PostScript language, introducing the core concepts of stack-based programming, vector graphics, and device-independent page description.

== Key Features

=== Core Language

* Stack-based execution model
* Dictionary-based name lookup
* Dynamic typing
* Procedures (executable arrays)
* Composite data types (arrays, strings, dictionaries)

=== Graphics Capabilities

* Vector path construction (moveto, lineto, curveto)
* Path painting (stroke, fill)
* Coordinate transformations
* Clipping paths
* Grayscale imaging

=== Type System

* Simple types: integer, real, boolean, mark, null
* Composite types: array, string, dictionary
* Special types: name, operator, file, save

=== Limitations

* **No Color**: Only grayscale support
* **Fixed Dictionary Size**: Dictionaries have fixed capacity (dictfull error)
* **No Composite Fonts**: Single-byte character encoding only
* **Limited Image Support**: Basic monochrome images only
* **No Forms**: Cannot cache complex graphics
* **No Patterns**: No tiling pattern support

== Implementation

Level 1 implementations provide approximately 250 operators covering:

* Stack manipulation
* Arithmetic and mathematics
* Array and string operations
* Dictionary operations
* Control flow
* Graphics state management
* Path construction and painting
* Font operations
* File I/O
* Memory management
