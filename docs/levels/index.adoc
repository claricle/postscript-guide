PostScript has evolved through three major versions, each adding significant capabilities while maintaining backward compatibility.

== Overview

PostScript was developed by Adobe Systems and released in three major levels, each building upon the previous version with enhanced features and capabilities.

== Evolution Timeline

[cols="1,2,4"]
|===
|Level |Release Year |Key Features

|xref:level-1.adoc[Level 1]
|1984
|Original specification with basic imaging model, stack-based execution, vector graphics, and font handling

|xref:level-2.adoc[Level 2]
|1990
|Added color extensions, composite fonts, filters, forms, patterns, file system, and performance improvements

|xref:level-3.adoc[Level 3]
|1996
|Introduced smooth shading, better color management, improved PDF integration, and additional imaging features
|===

== Version Documentation

=== xref:level-1.adoc[PostScript Level 1]

The original PostScript specification introduced:

* Stack-based execution model
* Basic imaging operators
* Path construction and painting
* Font rendering
* Device independence
* Coordinate transformations

xref:level-1.adoc[Read more about Level 1 →]

=== xref:level-2.adoc[PostScript Level 2]

Level 2 extended PostScript with:

* Color spaces (DeviceRGB, DeviceCMYK, DeviceGray, CIE-based)
* Composite fonts and CID-keyed fonts
* Binary encoding for efficiency
* Filters (compression, decompression)
* Forms (cached graphical objects)
* Patterns (tiling patterns)
* Image operators enhancements
* File system and named resources
* Better memory management

=== xref:level-3.adoc[PostScript Level 3]

Level 3 added advanced features:

* Smooth shading (gradient fills)
* DeviceN and Separation color spaces
* In-RIP separations
* Better PDF integration
* Improved halftoning
* Better device control
* Enhanced font support

== xref:comparison.adoc[Feature Comparison]

For a detailed comparison of features across all three levels, see the xref:comparison.adoc[version comparison table].

== Compatibility

PostScript interpreters are generally backward compatible:

* A Level 2 interpreter can execute Level 1 programs
* A Level 3 interpreter can execute Level 1 and Level 2 programs
* Programs can query the language level using the `languagelevel` operator

=== Checking Language Level

[source,postscript]
----
languagelevel       % Returns 1, 2, or 3
1 eq {              % If Level 1
    % Use Level 1 features only
} {
    languagelevel 2 eq {  % If Level 2
        % Can use Level 2 features
    } {
        % Can use Level 3 features
    } ifelse
} ifelse
----

== Choosing the Right Level

When writing PostScript programs:

* **Use Level 1** if maximum compatibility is required
* **Use Level 2** for color documents, better performance, and modern features
* **Use Level 3** for advanced imaging, smooth shading, and optimal PDF workflow

Most modern PostScript interpreters support Level 3, but it's good practice to:

1. State the required level in document comments
2. Use conditional code for optional features
3. Test on target devices when possible

== Document Structuring Comments

Declare the PostScript level in your document header:

[source,postscript]
----
%!PS-Adobe-3.0
%%LanguageLevel: 2
%%Creator: My Application
%%Title: Sample Document
%%EndComments
----
